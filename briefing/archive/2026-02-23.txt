DAILY BRIEFING — Monday, Feb 23, 2026

TOP PRIORITY (Due Today)

- YAK-295: Get the Layaway app quote done and sent. URGENT. No excuses, this ships today.
- YAK-303: Consolidate Phoodle uploaders. Due today. Wrap it up or flag what's left.
- YAK-296: Freedrop regular promo regression testing. Due today. Finish the pass.

THIS WEEK

Yak Dev Company
- YAK-326: Bi-weekly invoice send due Friday 2/27. Start tracking hours now.
- YAK-321: Tax preparer decision due 3/3. Start thinking about it this week.

Fiddletree
- YAK-327: 20 hrs/week commitment due 2/28. Make sure you're on pace.

Freedrop
- YAK-296 wraps today, then stack: YAK-300 (active state), YAK-299 (brand promo flow), YAK-298 (creator connection), YAK-297 (base website promos).
- YAK-283: Reward Break is in QA with Inaam. Review it when he's ready.

Phoodle
- YAK-302: Webview blocking is ready to pick up after today's dues clear.

BLOCKED / WAITING

- YAK-304: Phoodle mini UI update. Dead in the water until designs arrive. Poke whoever owes you those.
- YAK-311: Bi-weekly invoice send has no due date. Looks like a duplicate of YAK-326. Clean one up.

LOW PRIORITY (On the radar)

- The Association: Hosting (YAK-307) and Jaron testing convo (YAK-308)
- Clubhouse Customs: Marketing site (YAK-306)
- Freedrop: Secret Item (YAK-278), Code Snippet (YAK-275), Page Preview (YAK-274)
- YAK-10: Temp CRM still lingering in backlog

Three things today: Layaway quote, Phoodle consolidation, Freedrop regression. Go.
