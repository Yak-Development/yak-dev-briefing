TOP PRIORITY (Overdue / Due This Week)

- YAK-303: Phoodle uploader consolidation — DUE YESTERDAY. Close this out or update the date. Don't let it linger.
- YAK-296: Freedrop regular promo regression — also DUE YESTERDAY. Same deal. Finish or reschedule.
- YAK-326: Bi-weekly invoice send — due Friday 2/27. Start assessing work across projects now so Friday is just send.
- YAK-327: Fiddletree 20 hrs/week — due Saturday 2/28. High priority, in progress. Make sure you're on pace.

THIS WEEK BY PROJECT

Freedrop:
- YAK-283: Reward Break is in QA with Inaam. Review it when ready.
- YAK-296/297/298/299/300/301: Big stack of Todo work. Focus on finishing regression (296) first, then unblock the rest.

Phoodle:
- YAK-303: Close it out (overdue).
- YAK-302: Webview blocking is next up.

Yak Dev Company:
- YAK-321: Choose/confirm tax preparer by 3/3. That's next week. Start thinking about it now.
- YAK-311: Older invoice task has no due date — duplicate of 326? Clean up.

---

BLOCKED / WAITING

- YAK-304: Phoodle mini UI update — blocked on designs. Who has them? Follow up or it'll sit forever.
- Tax tasks (313-325): All unassigned and in backlog. The earliest ones are due 3/5. That's 9 days out. Assign yourself or delegate this week.

---

LOW PRIORITY (On the radar)

- The Association: Hosting (307) and Jaron testing (308) — no dates, low priority.
- Clubhouse Customs: Marketing site (306) — no date.
- YAK-10: Temp CRM — still floating in backlog.

---

Bottom line: Kill those two overdue tasks today. Prep for Friday invoicing. Start tax triage before it sneaks up on you.
